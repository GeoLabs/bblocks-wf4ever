# wfprov:Artifact

## Description

An **Artifact** represents a data entity that was used as input or generated as output during a workflow execution. Artifacts are the data products consumed or produced by process runs.

## Properties

- `@id` : Unique identifier for the artifact
- `@type` : Type of the entity (Artifact)
- `describedByParameter` : Links to the parameter description (Input or Output) that this artifact corresponds to
- `value` : The actual value or reference to the artifact data
- `wasOutputFrom` : The process run that generated this artifact

## Relations

- Can be linked to a `wfdesc:Input` or `wfdesc:Output` via `describedByParameter`
- Can be generated by a `wfprov:ProcessRun` via `wasOutputFrom`
- Can be used by a `wfprov:ProcessRun` via `prov:used`

## Example

```json
{
  "@id": "artifact/ndvi_result.tif",
  "@type": "Artifact",
  "describedByParameter": "#ndvi-output",
  "value": "file:///data/ndvi_result.tif",
  "wasOutputFrom": "#ndvi-process-run-1"
}
```
